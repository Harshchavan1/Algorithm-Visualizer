# Pathfinding-Visualizer
# Description
Visualization of this kind helps to understand the general idea behind every implemented algorithm.
The application is written mainly for educational purposes: to learn more about pathfinding, maze generation, and to challenge my software development skills.


#### Implemented pathfinding algorithms:
- A*
- Dijkstra's
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
- Greedy best-first search
- Bidirectional breadth-first search

#### Implemented maze generation algorithms:
- Recursive division
- Randomized depth-first search (backtracker)
- Spiral 
- Simple stair pattern

#### Implemented features:
- Adjustable animation speed
- Draggable route points
- Real time revisualization
- Intermediate route point (parcel)
- Manual creation and removal of walls
